    * Building and outputting the tree (look at P2 Tree File):
        To define the node: note that it needs a label, could be string, and should be the same as the function name generating it
        should have any tokens processed in the function (only ids, integers, and relational operators and those from expressions need to be stored),
        and finally will have children for each nonterminal in a production 
        - I believe you hav eat most 4 nonterminals per production
