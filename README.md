This project implements a recursive descent parser for a custom programming language. The parser generates a syntax tree to represent the hierarchical structure of the input code. The syntax tree is then traversed in a pre-order manner, providing a visual representation of the parsed code.

## Features

- **Token Handling:** The parser recognizes and handles different token types, such as identifiers and integers.

- **Non-Terminal Parsing:** The code includes functions for parsing non-terminals, creating corresponding nodes in the syntax tree.

- **Tree Traversal:** The syntax tree is traversed in a pre-order fashion, facilitating a structured visualization of the parsed code.
